I just want to share what I've come up with about the design of a new programming language, and here it is.
This language has a very strong type system and its functions are call-by-value.
Currently this language aims to be a functional general-purpose language, that is, to make higher abstraction possible but still retain the ability to write imperative code.
Anyone is very welcome to steal some ideas or write an implementation for it (but don't use the exact same name for the language).
